##Steps to establish a LoRaWAN link between two RN2483 microchip motes at 43MHz and 868MHz:

Connect the RN2483 motes to a computer using a USB-to-UART adapter.

Install the Arduino IDE and the MCCI LoRaWAN LMIC library on the computer.

Use the Arduino IDE to upload the LMIC library and the example sketch "ttn-otaa" to both RN2483 motes.

In the "ttn-otaa" sketch, set the following parameters:

DEVEUI: the unique device EUI for the mote (in little-endian byte order).
APPEUI: the unique application EUI for the LoRaWAN network (in little-endian byte order).
APPKEY: the unique application key for the LoRaWAN network (in little-endian byte order).
freqPlan: the frequency plan for the LoRaWAN network.
Connect an antenna to each RN2483 mote and place them at least 10km apart in an open-air environment.

Power on both RN2483 motes.

Monitor the serial output of the Arduino IDE for both motes to confirm that they have successfully joined the LoRaWAN network.

In the "ttn-otaa" sketch, modify the sendFrame function to send a message from one mote to the other using the LMIC_setTxData2 function.

Upload the modified "ttn-otaa" sketch to the first RN2483 mote and monitor the serial output to confirm that the message has been transmitted.

Monitor the serial output of the second RN2483 mote to confirm that it has received the message.

Repeat steps 8-10 to send messages between the two motes as needed.

Note: Depending on the LoRaWAN network used, it may be necessary to register the device EUI, application EUI, and application key with the network provider before attempting to join the network. Please consult the documentation for your specific LoRaWAN network for more information.
